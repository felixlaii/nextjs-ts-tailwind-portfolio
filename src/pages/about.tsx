            <p>Hello all, Im Felix! I love learning new things and this is where I like to keep my fun apps. I enjoy social media, dogs and music, so the apps I create are a mixture of those types of applications. Im currently looking into contributing into open source projects and to participate into hackathons as I feel like it will help expand my knowledge and experience. I am a full stack developer with 1+ years experience, and I also have 10 years of luxury retail management under my belt.</p>
